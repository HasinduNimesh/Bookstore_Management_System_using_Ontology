# 🚚 Restock Delay System - Complete Implementation

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### Backend Changes (`mesa_model.py`)

#### 1. **Pending Restocks Tracking**
```python
# In __init__
self.pending_restocks: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]] = {}
# Format: {sku: {"amount": int, "delivery_tick": int, "ordered_tick": int}}
```

#### 2. **Delayed Restock Orders**
```python
# When stock hits threshold
if item["onHand"] <= item["threshold"] and sku not in self.pending_restocks:
    restock_qty = item["restockAmount"]
    delivery_delay = 3  # Takes 3 ticks to arrive
    delivery_tick = self.current_tick + delivery_delay
    
    # Place order (won't arrive until delivery_tick)
    self.pending_restocks[sku] = {
        "amount": restock_qty,
        "delivery_tick": delivery_tick,
        "ordered_tick": self.current_tick
    }
    
    # Emit "restock_ordered" event
    self.add_event({
        "type": "inventory",
        "category": "restock_ordered",  # NEW event type
        ...
    })
```

#### 3. **Delivery Processing**
```python
def _process_pending_restocks(self):
    """Process pending restock deliveries that have arrived."""
    for sku, order in self.pending_restocks.items():
        if self.current_tick >= order["delivery_tick"]:
            # Restock has arrived!
            item["onHand"] += order["amount"]
            self.metrics["restocks"] += 1
            
            # Emit "restock" event (delivery completed)
            self.add_event(...)
```

#### 4. **Grid State Enhancement**
```python
def get_grid_state(self):
    return {
        "width": ...,
        "height": ...,
        "occupied": [...],
        "pendingRestocks": [  # NEW field
            {
                "sku": sku,
                "title": ...,
                "amount": ...,
                "deliveryTick": ...,
                "orderedTick": ...,
                "ticksRemaining": delivery_tick - current_tick
            }
            for sku, order in self.pending_restocks.items()
        ]
    }
```

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. **TypeScript Interfaces** (`appStore.ts`)
```typescript
export interface PendingRestock {
  sku: string
  title: string
  amount: number
  deliveryTick: number
  orderedTick: number
  ticksRemaining: number
}

export interface GridState {
  width: number
  height: number
  occupied: OccupiedPosition[]
  pendingRestocks?: PendingRestock[]  // NEW field
}
```

#### 2. **State Management** (`appStore.ts`)
```typescript
interface AppState {
  // ... existing fields
  pendingRestocks: PendingRestock[]
}

// In updateTick action
pendingRestocks: data.grid?.pendingRestocks || []
```

#### 3. **Visual Components**

**HMMDashboard.tsx:**
- **🚚 ORDER Event**: Shows when restock is ordered with countdown
- **Pending Restocks Panel**: Live countdown for each in-transit order
- **Enhanced Recent Events**: Shows "restock_ordered" events

**SimulationCanvas.tsx:**
- **Header Badge**: Shows count of restocks in transit
- **Orange indicator**: Visual cue for pending deliveries

## 📊 How It Works (Timeline)

### Example Scenario:

```
Tick 0:  Dune has 8 units (threshold: 5)

Tick 3:  Purchase → 7 units
Tick 5:  Purchase → 6 units
Tick 7:  Purchase → 5 units (≤ threshold!)
         → 🚚 RESTOCK ORDERED: +10 units
         → Delivery scheduled for Tick 10
         → "ORDER: Dune +10 units ordered ⏳ Arrives in 3 ticks"

Tick 8:  Purchase → 4 units
         → Pending Restocks Panel shows: "2 ticks left"

Tick 9:  Purchase → 3 units
         → Pending Restocks Panel shows: "1 tick left"
         → ⚠️ Still low stock!

Tick 10: 📦 DELIVERY ARRIVES! → 3 + 10 = 13 units
         → "RESTOCK: Dune +10 → 13 units"
         → Pending Restocks Panel clears

Tick 11: Stock replenished, operations normal
```

### The Key Difference:

**BEFORE (Instant):**
```
Tick 7: 5 units → Purchase → 5 ≤ threshold → INSTANT +10 = 15
        Stock never depletes!
```

**AFTER (Delayed):**
```
Tick 7: 5 units → Purchase → 5 ≤ threshold → Order placed
Tick 8: 4 units → Purchase → 4 (still low)
Tick 9: 3 units → Purchase → 3 (critical!)
Tick 10: 3 units → DELIVERY ARRIVES → +10 = 13
         Stock CAN deplete to 0 during delay!
```

## 🎨 Visual Indicators

### 1. **Recent Events Panel** (Right Side)

**🚚 ORDER Event (Orange):**
```
🚚 ORDER: Atomic Habits
+12 units ordered ⏳ Arrives in 3 ticks
```

**📦 RESTOCK Event (Green):**
```
📦 RESTOCK: Atomic Habits
+12 → 22 units
```

**❌ STOCKOUT Event (Red):**
```
❌ STOCKOUT: Dune
Out of stock!
```

### 2. **Pending Restocks Panel** (NEW)

Shows live countdown for in-transit orders:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🚚 Pending Restocks (In Transit)       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 🚚  Dune                           3    │
│     +10 units ordered at tick 7    ticks│
│                                     left │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 🚚  Neuromancer                    2    │
│     +8 units ordered at tick 8     ticks│
│                                     left │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3. **Grid Header Badge**

Shows count of pending orders:
```
🚚 2 Restocks In Transit
```

### 4. **Inventory Table**

Shows low stock (red) even with restock ordered:
```
Title          On Hand  Threshold  Restock
Dune              3        5         10    🔴 LOW (restock ordered)
```

## 🎯 Why This Matters

### 1. **Realism**
- Real-world restocks take time (shipping, processing)
- Demonstrates supply chain delays
- Shows inventory pressure

### 2. **Stockouts Now Possible**
- Stock can deplete to 0 during 3-tick delay
- High demand → stockout even with restock ordered
- Demonstrates failure cases

### 3. **Visual Storytelling**
- Watch orders being placed (orange)
- See countdown ticking down
- Observe delivery arrivals (green)
- Experience stockouts (red)

### 4. **Assignment Value**
- Shows **complex state management** (pending orders)
- Demonstrates **temporal logic** (delivery scheduling)
- Proves **event-driven architecture** (order → delivery)
- Illustrates **multi-agent coordination** (customer demand vs. supply chain)

## 🚀 How to See It in Action

### 1. Restart Services

**Backend:**
```powershell
cd ontology-mas-ui\backend
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Frontend:**
```powershell
cd ontology-mas-ui\frontend
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173
```

### 2. Run Simulation

1. Go to `http://localhost:5173`
2. Click **"Load Sample Ontology"**
3. Click **"Configure"** (loads reduced inventory)
4. Click **"Start"**

### 3. Watch For:

**Tick 3-5:** First purchases deplete stock
**Tick 6-8:** Stock hits threshold → **🚚 ORDER placed**
**Tick 9:** **Pending Restocks panel appears** with countdown
**Tick 10-12:** Stock continues depleting (danger zone!)
**Tick 11-13:** **📦 DELIVERY arrives** → stock replenished
**Possibly:** **❌ STOCKOUT** if demand exceeds supply during delay

## 📊 Expected Metrics

With 3-tick delay and reduced starting inventory:

| Metric | Before (Instant) | After (Delayed) | Why |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|-----|
| Purchases | 223 | ~200-250 | Similar demand |
| Restocks | 21 | ~15-25 | Similar triggers |
| Stockouts | 0 | **5-15** | 🔴 NOW POSSIBLE! |
| Revenue | $4265 | ~$3800-4500 | Lost sales from stockouts |

## 🎥 Video Demonstration Script

```
"Let me show you our enhanced inventory management system with 
realistic restock delays.

[Point to grid header]
You can see we currently have 2 restocks in transit, indicated 
by this orange badge.

[Point to Recent Events]
Here we see an order event: '🚚 ORDER: Atomic Habits +12 units 
ordered, arrives in 3 ticks.' This means the employee has placed 
the restock order, but it won't arrive immediately.

[Point to Pending Restocks panel]
This new panel shows all pending deliveries with a live countdown. 
You can see Dune has 2 ticks remaining before the shipment arrives.

[Watch countdown]
Notice how the countdown decrements each tick... 2... 1... 

[Point to inventory]
Meanwhile, the stock continues to deplete. Dune is down to just 
2 units now, well below the threshold of 5.

[Delivery arrives]
And there we go! Tick 10 - the delivery has arrived. We see the 
green RESTOCK event: '📦 RESTOCK: Dune +10 → 12 units.' The 
pending restock disappears from the panel.

[Point to stockout if occurs]
In cases of very high demand, you might see a stockout occur 
during this delivery window, marked in red. This demonstrates 
how supply chain delays can cause temporary unavailability even 
when restocks are on the way.

This delay system makes our simulation much more realistic, 
showing how multi-agent systems must handle temporal constraints 
and asynchronous operations."
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Adjust Delivery Delay

In `mesa_model.py`, line ~347:
```python
delivery_delay = 3  # Change this value
```

- **1 tick**: Minimal delay (faster restocking)
- **3 ticks**: Realistic (default)
- **5 ticks**: Slow shipping (more stockouts)

### Adjust Initial Stock

In `bookstore_sample.ttl`:
```turtle
ex:Inv_Dune
    ex:availableQuantity "8"  # Lower = more stockouts
```

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- **Pending restocks dictionary**: O(n) where n = number of unique books
- **Maximum pending**: Typically 2-4 orders at once
- **Memory impact**: Negligible (~100 bytes per order)
- **Processing overhead**: Single loop per tick (very fast)

## ✅ Summary

### What Changed:
- ❌ **Before**: Instant restocking (unrealistic)
- ✅ **After**: 3-tick delivery delay (realistic)

### New Features:
1. **Pending restocks tracking** (backend state)
2. **Restock order events** (🚚 orange)
3. **Pending Restocks panel** (live countdown)
4. **Grid header badge** (transit count)
5. **Enhanced event types** (restock_ordered vs restock)

### Benefits:
- ✅ Stockouts now possible
- ✅ More realistic simulation
- ✅ Better visual storytelling
- ✅ Demonstrates temporal logic
- ✅ Shows asynchronous operations

### Assignment Impact:
Perfect demonstration of:
- Complex state management
- Event-driven architecture
- Temporal constraints
- Supply chain modeling
- Visual feedback systems

You're all set! 🚀 The delay system is fully implemented and ready to demonstrate!
