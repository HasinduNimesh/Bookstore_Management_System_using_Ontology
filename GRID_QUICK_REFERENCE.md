## Color Coding 🎨

### 🔵 Blue = Customer Agent
- **Role**: Browse bookstore, make purchases
- **Icon**: 👤 (person)
- **Behavior**: Emit observations (Purchase, Complaint, Silence)
- **Example**: `customer_5`, `customer_12`

### 🟢 Green = Service Agent  
- **Role**: Manage inventory, process sales
- **Icon**: 🛠️ (tools)
- **Behavior**: Restock books, handle purchase requests
- **Example**: `service_1`, `service_2`

### 🟣 Purple = Active Interaction
- **Role**: Customer requesting + Service processing
- **Icon**: 🛒 (shopping cart)
- **Meaning**: Message bus communication happening!
- **Example**: Customer buying "Atomic Habits"

### ⬜ White = Empty Space
- **Role**: Unoccupied grid position
- **Icon**: (none)
- **Coordinates**: Hover shows (x, y)

Event Stream shows:
🔹 INVENTORY: Purchase Atomic Habits -1 on-hand: 13

This means:
- Customer at position (6,2) requested "Atomic Habits"
- Service agent at position (6,2) processed the request
- Inventory decremented by 1 unit
- Revenue increased by $18.50
```

## Hover Tooltip Examples

### Over Blue Square:
```
Tooltip: "customer_3 at (2, 5)"
```

### Over Green Square:
```
Tooltip: "service_1 at (8, 3)"
```

### Over Purple Square:
```
Tooltip: "customer_7, service_1 at (6, 2)"
```

### Over White Square:
```
Tooltip: "Empty (4, 4)"
```

## How to Use in Video Presentation

### Script Example:
```
"Let me show you the simulation grid. 
[Point to screen]

These BLUE squares with person icons represent our 30 CUSTOMER AGENTS 
who are browsing the bookstore. Each one has a hidden emotional state 
that we infer using our Hidden Markov Model.

The GREEN squares with tool icons are SERVICE AGENTS - there are 2 of them.
They manage the inventory and process customer purchases.

Notice this PURPLE square? That's where a customer and service agent are 
at the same position - they're interacting! The customer is requesting 
a book, and the service agent is processing the sale through our 
message bus system.

If I hover over this agent [hover], you can see it's customer_5 at 
position 2, 3. And down here in the event stream, we can see the 
corresponding purchase event: 'Atomic Habits, stock decreased by 1'.

This visual representation demonstrates our multi-agent system in action,
with autonomous agents communicating through our ontology-driven 
architecture."
```

## Key Demonstration Points

1. ✅ **Agent Autonomy**: Each agent moves independently
2. ✅ **Role Differentiation**: Clear visual distinction
3. ✅ **Spatial Awareness**: Agents navigate shared environment
4. ✅ **Interaction Visualization**: Purple shows communication
5. ✅ **Real-Time Dynamics**: Watch agents move each tick
6. ✅ **Correlation**: Grid ↔ Event Stream ↔ Metrics

## Technical Details for Report

### Grid Specifications:
- **Dimensions**: 10×10 (100 cells)
- **Topology**: Torus (wraps at edges)
- **Occupancy**: Multiple agents per cell allowed
- **Update Frequency**: Every simulation tick

### Agent Properties:
- **Position**: (x, y) coordinates
- **Type**: Customer or Service
- **Unique ID**: Sequential integer
- **Movement**: Random walk pattern

## Comparison to Other MAS Visualizations

### NetLogo Style:
- Agents as colored dots
- ✅ Similar concept
- ❌ Less intuitive icons

### MASON Style:
- Agents as simple shapes
- ✅ Good spatial representation
- ❌ No emoji clarity

### Our Implementation:
- Agents as emoji icons with color coding
- ✅ Immediately intuitive
- ✅ Accessible (hover tooltips)
- ✅ Interactive (real-time)
- ✅ Professional (clean design)

## 📝 Summary

**What Changed:**
- ❌ Before: Generic blue dots (unclear)
- ✅ After: Specific icons + colors (crystal clear)

**Why It Matters:**
- Demonstrates agent heterogeneity
- Shows spatial coordination
- Visualizes message bus interactions
- Makes simulation comprehensible at a glance

**For Your Video:**
Perfect visual aid to explain:
1. Multi-agent architecture
2. Agent roles and behaviors  
3. Communication patterns
4. Real-time system dynamics

You're all set! 🚀
