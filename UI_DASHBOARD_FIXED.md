# 🎨 UI Dashboard Fixed - Now Shows Bookstore Data!

## ✅ What Was Changed

### **Before (Issues):**
- ❌ Showing abstract HMM "mood states" (Happy/Unhappy)
- ❌ "Observation Mix" chart showing Purchase/Complaint/Silence counts
- ❌ No visibility into actual books being purchased
- ❌ No real-time agent communication events
- ❌ No book titles or inventory details visible
- ❌ Events were replaced each tick instead of accumulated

### **After (Fixed):**
- ✅ **Real Book Inventory Chart** - Bar chart showing current stock vs. restock threshold for each book
- ✅ **Recent Events Panel** - Shows last 10 agent activities:
  - 📚 **PURCHASE events**: Book title, remaining stock, low stock warnings
  - 📦 **RESTOCK events**: Book restocked with quantity added
  - ❌ **STOCKOUT events**: Books that ran out of stock
  - 👤 **CUSTOMER events**: Customer agent observations
- ✅ **Inventory Snapshot Table** - Complete book list with:
  - Book titles (Clean Code, Dune, Sapiens, etc.)
  - Current stock levels
  - Restock thresholds
  - Restock amounts
- ✅ **Color-coded indicators**:
  - Red for low stock warnings
  - Blue for purchases
  - Green for restocks
  - Red for stockouts
- ✅ **Event accumulation** - Last 100 events kept for review

## 🚀 How to See It

### **1. Restart Frontend** (if already running)
```powershell
# In frontend terminal (Ctrl+C to stop first)
cd f:\BMS_Project_Ready_To_Run\ontology-mas-ui\frontend
npm run dev
```

### **2. Restart Backend** (if already running)
```powershell
# In backend terminal (Ctrl+C to stop first)
cd f:\BMS_Project_Ready_To_Run\ontology-mas-ui\backend
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### **3. Open Browser**
```
http://localhost:5173
```

### **4. Load & Run Simulation**
1. Click **"Load Sample Ontology"** button
2. Click **"Configure"** button
3. Set parameters (or use defaults):
   - Ticks: 100
   - Customers: 20
   - Service Agents: 2
4. Click **"Start Simulation"**

### **5. Watch the Magic! ✨**
- Purchases appear in real-time with book titles
- Inventory bars decrease as books are purchased
- Restocks happen automatically when stock is low
- All events stream live in the "Recent Events" panel

---

## 📊 What Data Shows

### **Real Bookstore Operations:**
- **Book Titles**: Clean Code, Dune, Sapiens, Deep Learning, etc.
- **Stock Levels**: Live inventory quantities
- **Purchases**: Which books customers are buying
- **Restocks**: When employees restock low inventory
- **Revenue**: Total sales in dollars
- **Stockouts**: Books that ran out

### **Agent Communications:**
- Customer agents browsing and purchasing
- Employee agents managing inventory
- Service agents inferring customer states (still shown in bottom table)

---

## 🎥 Perfect for Video Demo!

This dashboard now clearly demonstrates:

1. **Ontology Integration** ✅
   - Books from seed_books.json appear with real titles
   - Inventory properties (availableQuantity, threshold) visible

2. **Agent Behaviors** ✅
   - Customer purchases appear with agent IDs
   - Employee restocks shown in real-time
   - Agent communications logged

3. **SWRL Rules** ✅
   - Low stock detection (red threshold line)
   - Auto-restocking visible in events
   - Stock levels update correctly

4. **Multi-Agent Simulation** ✅
   - Multiple customers acting independently
   - Service agents inferring states
   - Grid showing agent positions

5. **Message Bus** ✅
   - Events stream through WebSocket
   - Purchase/restock messages visible
   - Real-time updates

## 🐛 If It's Not Showing Data

### **Problem: "No inventory data yet" message**

**Solution 1: Load Sample Ontology First**
```
1. Click "Load Sample Ontology" button (top right)
2. Wait for "Ontology Loaded" status
3. Then click "Configure"
4. Then click "Start Simulation"
```

**Solution 2: Restart Backend**
```powershell
# Stop backend (Ctrl+C)
cd f:\BMS_Project_Ready_To_Run\ontology-mas-ui\backend
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### **Problem: Events not appearing**

**Check WebSocket connection:**
- Look for "Connected" indicator (green dot) in bottom right
- If not connected, refresh browser page
- Check browser console (F12) for errors

### **Problem: Stock levels not changing**

**Ensure simulation is running:**
- "Stop" button should be visible (not "Start")
- Tick count should be increasing in title: "Simulation Grid (Tick: 69)"
- Grid should show agents moving

---

## 💡 Tips for Best Demo

### **1. Start Fresh**
```powershell
# Stop both terminals (Ctrl+C)
# Start backend
cd f:\BMS_Project_Ready_To_Run\ontology-mas-ui\backend
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Start frontend (new terminal)
cd f:\BMS_Project_Ready_To_Run\ontology-mas-ui\frontend
npm run dev
```

### **2. Load Ontology Before Configuring**
Always: Load → Configure → Start

### **3. Let It Run**
- Run for ~50-100 ticks to see interesting events
- Watch for restocks (green events)
- Look for low stock warnings (red ⚠️)

### **4. Point Out Key Features**
- "See how Clean Code is low on stock? That's SWRL rule detecting it"
- "Watch this restock event - that's the Employee agent responding"
- "Here's a purchase - Customer agent bought Dune"
- "The chart shows all 12 books from seed_books.json"

## 📁 Files Changed

### **Frontend:**
1. `ontology-mas-ui/frontend/src/components/HMMDashboard.tsx`
   - Replaced "Observation Mix" chart with "Book Inventory" chart
   - Added "Recent Events" live feed panel
   - Fixed event accumulation (last 100 events)
   - Added book titles and stock levels
   - Color-coded event types

2. `ontology-mas-ui/frontend/src/store/appStore.ts`
   - Changed events from replace to accumulate
   - Keep last 100 events for performance

### **Backend:**
No changes needed! It was already sending the right data.

## 🎬 Video Script Addition

**When showing the UI:**

> "Here's the live web dashboard I built. On the right, you can see the real book inventory from seed_books.json - books like Clean Code, Dune, and Sapiens.
> 
> This chart shows current stock levels in blue versus the restock threshold in red. When stock drops below the threshold, the SWRL rule triggers a restock.
> 
> Below that, we have a live event feed showing agent communications. See these purchase events? Those are Customer agents buying books. The green restock events are Employee agents responding to low stock.
> 
> Everything updates in real-time via WebSocket. The inventory table at the bottom shows all 12 books with their exact quantities, thresholds, and prices - all pulled from the ontology.
> 
> This demonstrates the complete integration: ontology providing data, agents acting on it, SWRL rules governing behavior, and the message bus coordinating everything."
