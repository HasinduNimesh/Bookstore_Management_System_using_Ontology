# 🎯 Simulation Grid Visualization - Now Clear & Intuitive!

## What the Grid Shows

The **Simulation Grid** is a 10×10 spatial environment where agents move around and interact. It visualizes the **multi-agent system** in action.

### 🔵 Blue Squares with 👤 = **Customer Agents**
- **Who**: Customers browsing the bookstore
- **Behavior**: 
  - Move randomly around the grid
  - Emit observations (Purchase, Complaint, Silence)
  - Hidden emotional states inferred by HMM
- **Count**: 30 customer agents (as configured)

### 🟢 Green Squares with 🛠️ = **Service Agents**
- **Who**: Employee/service staff managing inventory
- **Behavior**:
  - Monitor inventory levels
  - Process purchase requests
  - Restock items when below threshold
- **Count**: 2 service agents (as configured)

### 🟣 Purple Squares with 🛒 = **Customer + Service Interaction**
- **What**: When a customer and service agent occupy the same grid position
- **Meaning**: Active interaction (e.g., customer requesting a book, service agent processing sale)
- This shows **agent communication** via the message bus!

### ⬜ White Squares = **Empty Spaces**
- Unoccupied grid positions

## 🎨 Visual Legend (Now Displayed in UI)

The top of the grid now shows a legend:
- 🔵 👤 **Customer Agents** (browsing & purchasing)
- 🟢 🛠️ **Service Agents** (restocking inventory)

## 🖱️ Interactive Features

### Hover Tooltips
Hover over any grid square to see:
- **Occupied positions**: Shows agent IDs (e.g., "customer_3, service_1 at (5, 7)")
- **Empty positions**: Shows coordinates (e.g., "Empty (3, 4)")

### Real-Time Updates
- Grid updates every tick (simulation step)
- Agents move dynamically across the grid
- Colors change as agents enter/leave positions

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes (`mesa_model.py`)
```python
# OLD: Only sent coordinates
occupied.append([x, y])

# NEW: Sends full agent information
occupied.append({
    "x": x,
    "y": y,
    "agentId": f"{agent_type}_{agent.unique_id}",
    "agentType": agent_type  # 'customer' or 'service'
})
```

### Frontend Changes (`SimulationCanvas.tsx`)
```typescript
// Filters agents by position
const agentsHere = gridState.occupied.filter(
  (item) => item.x === x && item.y === y
)

// Determines color based on agent types
if (hasService && hasCustomer) {
  bgColor = 'bg-purple-500'  // Interaction
  icon = '🛒'
} else if (hasService) {
  bgColor = 'bg-green-500'
  icon = '🛠️'
} else {
  bgColor = 'bg-blue-500'
  icon = '👤'
}
```

### Type Safety (`appStore.ts`)
```typescript
export interface OccupiedPosition {
  x: number
  y: number
  agentId: string
  agentType: 'customer' | 'service'
}

export interface GridState {
  width: number
  height: number
  occupied: OccupiedPosition[]
}
```

## 📊 What This Demonstrates (For Assignment)

### 1. **Spatial Multi-Agent System**
- Agents exist in shared 2D environment
- Movement and positioning tracked

### 2. **Agent Heterogeneity**
- Different agent types (Customer vs Service)
- Distinct behaviors and roles
- Visual differentiation

### 3. **Agent Interaction**
- Purple squares show when agents meet
- Represents message bus communication (purchase requests/results)
- Demonstrates coordination

### 4. **Real-Time Visualization**
- Live updates as simulation runs
- Observable emergent behavior
- Immediate feedback

### 5. **Ontology Integration**
- Grid state synchronized with ontology individuals
- Agents are instances of Customer/ServiceAgent classes
- Positions tracked in semantic layer

## 🎥 Video Demonstration Points

When recording your video, highlight:

1. **Start simulation** - show grid populate with agents
2. **Point to blue squares** - "These are 30 customer agents browsing"
3. **Point to green squares** - "These 2 service agents manage inventory"
4. **Hover over agent** - "We can see agent IDs like customer_5"
5. **Watch movement** - "Agents move randomly each tick"
6. **Purple interaction** - "When they overlap, customers purchase books"
7. **Event stream correlation** - "Purchase events correspond to grid interactions"

## 🔗 Connection to Other Components

### Event Stream (Bottom Panel)
When you see a **Purchase event** in the stream:
- A **customer agent** (blue 👤) generated the event
- A **service agent** (green 🛠️) processed it
- Grid shows their positions during interaction

### Recent Events (Right Panel)
**"📚 PURCHASE: Atomic Habits"** means:
- Customer agent emitted observation
- Service agent processed via message bus
- Inventory decremented
- Revenue increased

### Bookstore Metrics
- **Purchases**: Count of customer-service interactions
- **Restocks**: Service agent actions when threshold triggered
- **Stockouts**: Failed purchases due to empty inventory

## 📝 Assignment Requirements Met

✅ **Multi-Agent System**: Clearly shows multiple autonomous agents  
✅ **Agent Types**: Visual distinction between customer and service roles  
✅ **Spatial Environment**: 10×10 grid with movement  
✅ **Agent Communication**: Purple overlaps show interactions  
✅ **Real-Time Updates**: Live visualization of simulation state  
✅ **Ontology-Driven**: Agents are instances from OWL classes  
✅ **Interactive UI**: Hover tooltips, color coding, legend  

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Stop current simulation** if running
2. **Refresh browser** (F5) to load updated frontend
3. **Load Sample Ontology**
4. **Configure** simulation (30 customers, 2 service agents)
5. **Start** and watch the enhanced grid in action!

You should now see:
- Clear distinction between agent types
- Intuitive icons and colors
- Helpful hover tooltips
- Legend explaining the visualization

Perfect for your assignment video! 🎉
