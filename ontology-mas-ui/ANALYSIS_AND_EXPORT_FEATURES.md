- **Business insights**: Identify periods of high activity or revenue plateaus

#### Agent Communication Breakdown (Pie Chart)
- Shows distribution of message types:
  - üõí Purchase Requests (blue)
  - üí¨ Service Responses (purple)
  - üì¶ Restock Orders (green)
  - ‚úÖ Deliveries (orange)

#### Customer State Distribution (Pie Chart)
- Shows HMM-inferred emotional states:
  - Happy (green)
  - Neutral (blue)
  - Unhappy (red)

#### Event Type Summary (Bar Chart)
- Visual comparison of:
  - Purchases
  - Complaints
  - Silence observations
  - Restocks
  - Stockouts

#### Final Inventory Levels (Horizontal Bar Chart)
- Shows for each book:
  - Current stock (green)
  - Restock threshold (red)
- Helps identify which books sold well

### 5. **Communication Statistics** üìä
Detailed breakdown showing:
- üõí Total purchase requests
- üí¨ Total service responses
- üì¶ Total restock orders
- ‚úÖ Total deliveries confirmed

## How to Use

### During Simulation
1. **Watch messages appear** in the bottom-center panel
2. Messages are color-coded by type
3. Scroll to see older messages (they never disappear!)
4. Total count shows in header badge

### After Simulation
1. **Automatic**: Summary pops up 1 second after simulation stops
2. **Manual**: Click "üìä View Analysis" button anytime
3. **Review charts** to understand simulation behavior
4. **Download data**:
   - Click "üì¶ Download All Data (JSON)" for complete dataset
   - Click "üí¨ Download Messages (CSV)" for message log

### Analyzing Downloaded Data

#### JSON File Contents
```json
{
  "simulationSummary": {
    "totalTicks": 50,
    "timestamp": "2025-10-07T..."
  },
  "metrics": {
    "purchases": 45,
    "stockouts": 12,
    "restocks": 8,
    "revenue": 678.45,
    ...

      "content": "I want to buy 'Dune'",
      "tick": 12,
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

14,"EmployeeAgent","Supplier","restock_request","Order 15 units of 'Harry Potter'","Book_HarryPotter","15"
```

## Technical Details

### Performance Considerations
- **All events are kept** in memory during simulation
- For very long simulations (1000+ ticks), this may use more RAM
- The UI remains responsive due to virtual scrolling
- Download operations are handled client-side (no server overhead)

### Data Persistence
- Events are stored in Zustand state management
- Data is NOT persisted between page refreshes
- **Important**: Download data before closing browser!

### Browser Compatibility
- Works in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- File downloads use standard Blob API
- Charts rendered using Recharts library

## Use Cases

### Academic Research
- Export all data for statistical analysis
- Import CSV into R, Python pandas, or SPSS
- Analyze agent behavior patterns
- Study HMM inference accuracy

### Debugging
- Review complete message log to understand agent interactions
- Check if restocks are arriving on time
- Verify customer state transitions
- Identify bottlenecks in the system

### Presentations
- Use charts directly from summary dashboard
- Export data for custom visualizations
- Show message log to demonstrate agent communication
- Prove system is working correctly (real data, not mock!)

### Comparison Studies
- Run multiple simulations with different parameters
- Download data from each run
- Compare results side-by-side
- Identify optimal configuration

## Tips

1. **Run shorter simulations first** (50-100 ticks) to get familiar with data structure
2. **Check message count** in real-time to ensure agents are communicating
3. **Download immediately** after simulation completes
4. **Open JSON in a viewer** (like https://jsonviewer.stack.hu) for better readability
5. **Use CSV** for quick analysis in Excel or Google Sheets

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Save simulation history to local storage
- [ ] Compare multiple simulation runs side-by-side
- [ ] Export charts as images (PNG/SVG)
- [ ] Time-series charts showing metrics over ticks
- [ ] Filter messages by agent or topic
- [ ] Search functionality in message log
