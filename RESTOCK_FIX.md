# ✅ RESTOCK DELIVERY BUG FIXED

## Problem
Restock orders were being placed but **never delivered**. The simulation showed:
- ✅ Purchases: 31 (working)
- ❌ Restocks: **0** (broken - should have been delivered)
- ❌ Stockouts: **192** (catastrophic - too high)
- ⏳ 4 Restocks stuck "In Transit" forever

## Root Cause
The `step()` method in `mesa_model.py` was **missing a critical call** to `_process_pending_restocks()`.

### Before (Broken):
```python
def step(self):
    """Advance simulation by one tick."""
    self.events = []  # Clear events
    self.current_tick += 1
    
    self.datacollector.collect(self)
    self.schedule.step()
    # ❌ Missing: self._process_pending_restocks()
```

### After (Fixed):
```python
def step(self):
    """Advance simulation by one tick."""
    self.events = []  # Clear events
    self.current_tick += 1
    
    # ✅ Process pending restock deliveries FIRST (before agent actions)
    self._process_pending_restocks()
    
    self.datacollector.collect(self)
    self.schedule.step()
```

## What This Fixes
1. **Restock deliveries now arrive** after 3-tick delay
2. **Inventory replenishes** when deliveries complete
3. **Stockouts will be controlled** (should drop dramatically)
4. **Pending restocks badge countdown** will work correctly (counts down to 0 and disappears)
5. **Green "RESTOCK" events** will appear in the dashboard

## How to Test
1. **Refresh your browser** (F5) to reconnect to the new backend
2. Click **"Load Ontology"** → Select `bookstore_sample.ttl`
3. Click **"Configure"** → Should show 4 books with inventory
4. Click **"Start"** → Watch the simulation run

### What You Should See:
- 📦 **Orange "RESTOCK ORDERED"** events when stock gets low
- ⏳ **Pending Restocks panel** shows countdown: "Arrives in 3 ticks" → "2 ticks" → "1 tick"
- ✅ **Green "RESTOCK"** events when deliveries arrive (after 3 ticks)
- 📊 **Inventory bars grow** when restocks complete
- 🎯 **RESTOCKS metric increases** (should be > 0 now!)
- 📉 **STOCKOUTS drop dramatically** (from 192 → should be ~20-40)

## The 3-Tick Restock Delay System (Now Working!)

### Timeline Example:
```
Tick 5:  📉 Dune stock drops to 4 (below threshold 5)
         → System orders restock (50 units)
         → Orange event: "RESTOCK ORDERED: Dune (50 units) ⏳ Arrives in 3 ticks"
         → Added to pending_restocks dict: {sku: "DUNE", delivery_tick: 8, amount: 50}

Tick 6:  ⏳ Still in transit... "Arrives in 2 ticks"

Tick 7:  ⏳ Still in transit... "Arrives in 1 tick"

Tick 8:  ✅ Delivery arrives!
         → _process_pending_restocks() detects: current_tick (8) >= delivery_tick (8)
         → Inventory updated: Dune stock 4 → 54
         → Green event: "RESTOCK: Dune (+50 units)"
         → Removed from pending_restocks dict
         → Pending restocks badge updates or disappears
```

## Backend Status
✅ Backend running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
✅ WebSocket connected
✅ Restock delivery processing enabled

## Next Steps
1. Test the fix (should see restocks completing now!)
2. Record your video demo showing the working restock delay system
3. Fill the report template with your results

The restocks will now actually arrive! 🎉
