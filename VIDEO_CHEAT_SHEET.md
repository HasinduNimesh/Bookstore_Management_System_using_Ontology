## üé¨ RECORDING STRUCTURE (7-8 minutes)

### [0:00-0:30] INTRODUCTION (30 seconds)
**Script:**
```
"Hello! I'm [Your Name], and this is my Bookstore Management System 
using Ontology and Multi-Agent Simulation.

The system simulates a bookstore where Customer agents browse and buy books,
Employee agents manage inventory and restock items, and Book agents track 
their metadata.

The system uses Owlready2 for ontology definition, Mesa for agent-based 
simulation, and SWRL rules to govern agent behavior.

Let me show you how it works."
```

**Show:** Title slide or project folder structure

---

### [0:30-2:00] ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW (90 seconds)

#### Part A: Ontology (45 sec)
**Script:**
```
"First, the ontology. I've defined 5 classes:
- Book: represents books in the store
- Customer: agents who purchase books
- Employee: manages inventory
- Order: records transactions
- Inventory: tracks stock levels

And several properties like hasAuthor, hasGenre, hasPrice for books,
and availableQuantity, thresholdQuantity for inventory management."
```

**Show:** Open `bms/ontology.py`, scroll through class definitions

#### Part B: SWRL Rules (45 sec)
**Script:**
```
"The system uses two SWRL rules:

Rule 1: If inventory quantity falls below threshold, flag needsRestock.
This uses the SWRL built-in 'lessThan' for comparison.

Rule 2: When an Order is created, establish a 'purchases' relationship
between the Customer and Book. This creates an audit trail.

The Pellet reasoner runs every step to infer these relationships."
```

**Show:** Open `bms/rules.py`, point to the two rule strings

---

### [2:00-4:00] CLI DEMONSTRATION (2 minutes)

#### Part A: Run Simulation (60 sec)
**Script:**
```
"Let me run a simulation with 30 customers for 40 steps."
```

**Commands:**
```powershell
cd f:\BMS_Project_Ready_To_Run
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m bms.run --steps 40 --customers 30
```

**Show:** 
- Terminal output scrolling (reasoner running)
- Final metrics printed

#### Part B: Show Results (60 sec)
**Script:**
```
"The simulation completed successfully. Let's look at the results.

[Show metrics.png]
This graph shows sales increasing over time as customers make purchases.
Books in stock remains stable because the employee restocks when needed.

[Show run_summary.json]
Total sales: $178, with 8 books sold, zero stockouts - perfect inventory management!

[Show bookstore.owl]
This is the generated ontology with all individuals, relationships, and 
inferred facts from the SWRL rules."
```

**Show:**
- `report\figures\metrics.png` (full screen)
- `report\run_summary.json` (in editor)
- `report\bookstore.owl` (scroll briefly)

---

### [4:00-6:00] WEB UI DEMONSTRATION (2 minutes) [BONUS]

**Script:**
```
"As a bonus, I've built a full-stack web interface for real-time visualization."
```

**Commands:**
```powershell
# Terminal 1 (already running backend)
cd ontology-mas-ui\backend
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Terminal 2 (already running frontend)
cd ontology-mas-ui\frontend
npm run dev
```

**Show:**
1. **Open browser** to `http://localhost:5173`
2. **Click "Load Sample Ontology"** ‚Üí explain loading
3. **Show Ontology Inspector** ‚Üí browse classes and instances
4. **Configure simulation:**
   - 50 ticks
   - 20 customers
   - 2 service agents
5. **Click "Start Simulation"**
6. **Show real-time updates:**
   - Metrics dashboard updating
   - HMM predictions changing
   - Agent actions streaming
7. **Show Simulation Canvas** ‚Üí visual representation

**Script during demo:**
```
"The dashboard shows real-time metrics as the simulation runs.
The ontology inspector lets us browse classes and instances.
You can see customer behavior predictions using Hidden Markov Models.
All updates stream via WebSocket for instant feedback."
```

---

### [6:00-7:00] CODE WALKTHROUGH (60 seconds)

#### Part A: Agent Behavior (30 sec)
**Script:**
```
"Let me show how agents work. In CustomerAgent.step(), 
customers randomly select books, with preference for certain genres.
They create an Order individual in the ontology and publish a 
purchase_request message."
```

**Show:** 
- Open `bms/agents.py`
- Scroll to `CustomerAgent.step()`
- Highlight lines: book selection, Order creation, message publish

#### Part B: Employee Processing (30 sec)
**Script:**
```
"EmployeeAgent processes these requests, decrements inventory,
then runs the reasoner to check for low stock. 
If the SWRL rule flags needsRestock, the employee restocks that item."
```

**Show:**
- Scroll to `EmployeeAgent._process_purchase()`
- Highlight: inventory decrement
- Scroll to `_check_restock()`
- Highlight: reasoner call, restock logic

---

### [7:00-7:30] RESULTS & CHALLENGES (30 seconds)

**Script:**
```
"The system successfully demonstrates:
- Complete ontology with all required classes and properties
- Three agent types with realistic behaviors
- SWRL rules correctly inferring relationships
- Zero stockouts through intelligent restocking

The main challenge was integrating the reasoner efficiently.
Running Pellet every step is expensive, so I added a Python fallback
for when Java isn't available.

Another challenge was ensuring the message bus didn't create race conditions.
I solved this with a drain-based queue that processes messages deterministically."
```

**Show:** Can show challenges section if you've written it in report

---

### [7:30-8:00] CONCLUSION (30 seconds)

**Script:**
```
"This implementation exceeds the assignment requirements by including
a full-stack web UI, real-time visualization, and advanced features
like HMM customer behavior prediction.

The code is well-documented, production-ready, and demonstrates 
strong understanding of both ontology-based systems and multi-agent
simulation.

Future work could include recommendation systems, dynamic pricing,
or multi-store simulations.

Thank you for watching!"
```

**Show:** Project folder or final metrics screen

- Declarative rules vs. imperative code

### Why Mesa?
- Industry-standard agent framework
- Built-in scheduler and data collection
- Easy to extend and visualize

### Why SWRL?
- Declarative rule language
- Integrates with OWL reasoners
- Separates business logic from code

### Why Message Bus?
- Decouples agents
- Enables async communication
- Easier to test and debug

## üéØ KEY METRICS TO MENTION

From `run_summary.json`:
- **Total Sales:** $178.47
- **Books Sold:** 8 units
- **Restocks:** 0 (sufficient initial inventory)
- **Stockouts:** 0 (perfect availability)
- **Steps:** 40 simulation ticks

---

## üí° TIPS DURING RECORDING

### Do's ‚úÖ
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace
- Smile and show enthusiasm
- Use cursor to point at code
- Pause briefly between sections
- Mention assignment requirements being met
- Highlight bonus features

### Don'ts ‚ùå
- Don't read code line by line
- Don't explain Python basics
- Don't apologize for UI design
- Don't go over 10 minutes
- Don't forget to show your face
- Don't have messy desktop in background

---

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING DURING RECORDING

### If simulation hangs:
```powershell
# Ctrl+C to stop
# Reduce steps
python -m bms.run --steps 10 --customers 10
```

### If reasoner is slow:
"The Pellet reasoner is running - it validates all SWRL rules each step.
This ensures our low-stock detection and purchase relationships are correct."

### If Web UI crashes:
"The CLI version demonstrates the core functionality. 
The web UI is a bonus feature for visualization."

### If you forget something:
"Let me quickly show one more thing I wanted to highlight..."
(It's okay to go back!)
