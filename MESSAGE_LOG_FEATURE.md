# ✅ Agent Message Communication Added!

## What's New
I've added a **Message Log panel** that shows real-time agent communications in the simulation! Now you can see exactly how agents talk to each other internally.

## New Layout
The UI now has **3 sections**:

```
┌─────────────┬──────────────────┬─────────────┐
│             │                  │             │
│  Ontology   │  Simulation Grid │  Dashboard  │
│  Inspector  │  (Top 2/3)       │  & Metrics  │
│             ├──────────────────┤             │
│             │  Message Log     │             │
│             │  (Bottom 1/3)    │             │
└─────────────┴──────────────────┴─────────────┘
```

## Message Types You'll See

### 🛒 Purchase Requests (Blue)
**From:** Customer → **To:** ServiceAgent
```
"I want to buy 'Dune'"
```
Sent when a customer wants to purchase a book

### 💬 Service Responses (Green)
**From:** ServiceAgent → **To:** Customer  
```
"Customer seems Happy, providing recommendation"
```
Service agent responds based on inferred customer mood

### 📦 Restock Orders (Orange)
**From:** EmployeeAgent → **To:** Supplier
```
"Order 50 units of 'Neuromancer'"
```
Sent when inventory hits threshold and restock is needed

### ✅ Delivery Confirmations (Emerald)
**From:** Supplier → **To:** EmployeeAgent
```
"Delivered 50 units of 'Neuromancer'"
```
Sent when restock arrives after 3-tick delay

## Message Details
Each message shows:
- **Icon** (🛒💬📦✅) for quick identification
- **From/To agents** - who's talking to whom
- **Tick number** - when the message was sent
- **SKU & Quantity** - for inventory-related messages
- **Message content** - what's being communicated

## Features
- **Last 20 messages** - Shows recent communications (auto-scrolling)
- **Color-coded** - Each message type has distinct background color
- **Real-time updates** - New messages appear instantly during simulation
- **Legend** - Quick reference at the bottom showing what each icon means

## How to Use
1. **Refresh your browser** (F5) to load the new layout
2. The bookstore ontology loads automatically now (no button!)
3. Click **Configure** → Set simulation parameters
4. Click **Start** → Watch the simulation
5. **Message Log** (bottom center) shows agent communications in real-time

## Technical Details

### Backend Changes (mesa_model.py):
- Added `message` events when:
  - Customers request purchases
  - Service agents respond to customers
  - Employees order restocks from suppliers
  - Suppliers confirm deliveries

### Frontend Changes:
- **New Component**: `MessageLog.tsx` - displays message stream
- **Updated Layout**: `App.tsx` - split center column to show grid + messages
- **Auto-load**: Bookstore ontology loads automatically on startup

## What You'll Learn
By watching the message log, you can see:
- **Customer behavior** - Which books customers want to buy
- **Service interactions** - How service agents respond to customer moods
- **Supply chain** - When restocks are ordered and delivered
- **Message flow** - Complete communication timeline between agents

This makes the multi-agent system much more transparent and understandable! 🎉
